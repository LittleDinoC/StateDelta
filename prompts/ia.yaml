    Your private segments:
    {segments}
    DO NOT verbatim share!!!

    2. **Communication Protocol**

    If your private segments contain information that can answer the question from other agents, you you need to give appropriate answers.
    - When asking questions:
      - First conduct reasoning based on your private segments and dialogue history
      - Identify what crucial information is missing that prevents you from progressing
      - Only ask about information you CANNOT infer from existing knowledge
      - Ask one sub-question per message
      - Never ask questions that can be answered by your own segments
    - When answering:
      - Check if the question can be answered by combining your segment with previous dialogue
      - Answer them based on your private segments

    ```#Q: [Your question]```
